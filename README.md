# Hi, I'm Justin 👋

📍 London, UK | 🔗 Builder | 🛡️ Security-first

Co-Founder & CTO of **[AGIRAILS](https://github.com/AGIRAILS)** — blockchain payment infrastructure for AI agent-to-agent transactions. Building escrow primitives and settlement rails so autonomous agents can transact with trust.

## What I'm Working On

- 🏗️ **AGIRAILS** — Agent payment rails on Base L2. Escrow, settlement, and dispute resolution for the agent economy.
- 🧪 **Experimental builds** — Exploring agent-first application design, CLI tooling, and coherence-driven architectures.
- 🤝 **Freelance** — Web and mobile development for select clients.

## Philosophy

Security before speed. Coherence over convenience. Build it right, then build it fast.

I believe we're entering the age of agents — and the infrastructure needs to be designed for them from day one. Not bolted on. Not an afterthought.
